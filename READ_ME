Creating a Super Hero Chess game Using Object Oriented programing.

Super Heroes Chess (SHC) is a two-player strategic board game inspired by traditional chess. 
The first main difference is that the pieces represent superheroes with super powers or
advanced abilities alongside their sidekicks, instead of the traditional pieces. 
Each different hero piece has a unique power that performs a certain purpose.
The sidekick pieces are there to aid the heroes in their mission.
The main objective of the game is to deliver a payload over to the base of the opposing player by eliminating a specific number of their pieces,
rather than eliminating the king piece in the traditional chess.

A full game, engine and GUI, built from scratch using Java and its swing libraries.
